    Emulator clock helpers.

    Do this:
    ~~~C
    #define CHIPS_IMPL
    ~~~
    before you include this file in *one* C or C++ file to create the 
    implementation.

    Optionally provide the following macros with your own implementation
    
    ~~~C
    CHIPS_ASSERT(c)
    ~~~
        your own assert macro (default: assert(c))

    ## Functions

    ~~~C
    void clk_init(clk_t* clk, uint32_t freq_hz)
    ~~~
        Initialize a clk_t instance with a frequency in Hz.

    ~~~C
    uint32_t clk_ticks_to_run(clk_t* clk, double time_in_seconds)
    ~~~
        Compute the number of ticks to execute for the given time in seconds.
        Usually this is called once per frame to compute the required
        number of ticks for a CPU emulator to run in realtime.

    ~~~C
    void clk_ticks_executed(clk_t* clk, uint32_t ticks)
    ~~~
        Call this function after the CPU emulator has executed ticks 
        with the actual number of ticks executed by the emulator. 
        This computes the number of 'overrun ticks' to be subtracted
        from the number of ticks to execute in the next call to
        clk_ticks_to_tun().

    ## Example

    For a Z80 system running a 2 MHz initialize a clk_t instance like
    this:

    ~~~C
        clk_t clk;
        clk_init(&clk, 2000000);
    ~~~

    Then in the per-frame callback, you can call the z80_exec() function
    like this to run the emulated system at the right speed:

    ~~~C
    double frame_time_in_seconds = ...;
    uint32_t ticks_to_run = clk_ticks_to_run(&clk, frame_time_in_seconds));
    uint32_t ticks_executed = z80_exec(&cpu, ticks_to_run);
    clk_ticks_executed(&clk, ticks_executed);
    ~~~
