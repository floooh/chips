# chips

A toolbox of chips and helper code to write 8-bit emulators in
dependency-free C99-headers.

Tests and example code is in a separate repo: https://github.com/floooh/chips-test

This is the meaty stuff from the YAKC emulator, rewritten from
C++ in C, moved into its own project.

The YAKC emulator is here:
- github repo: https://github.com/floooh/yakc
- asm.js/wasm demo: http://floooh.github.io/virtualkc/


## What's New

* **23-Jul-2018**: all chip emulators with callbacks now have an extra
```user_data``` argument in the callbacks which is provided in the init
function, this makes the chip emulators a bit more flexible when more than
one emulator of the same type is used in a program

## Chip Emulators

### Z80 CPU (chips/z80.h)

The Zilog Z80 CPU.

- tick-callback with CPU-pin bitmask, called with machine-cycle or single-tick granularity
- fast switch-case instruction decoder generated via python script
- up to 7 wait states can be injected per machine cycle by setting WAIT pins in 
  the CPU tick callback
- all undocumented instructions supported
- internal WZ register and undocumented XF and YF flags supported
- support for interrupt-priority handling (daisy chain) with help from the tick callback
- runs the ZEXDOC and ZEXALL tests (more to be added)
- NOT IMPLEMENTED/TODO:
    - NMI (non-maskable interrupts)
    - interrupt mode 0
    - refresh cycle in second half of opcode fetch machine cycle
    - bus request/acknowledge (BUSRQ/BUSAK pins)
    - sequences of DD/FD prefix bytes behave differently than a real CPU

### Z80 PIO (chips/z80pio.h)

The Zilog Z80 Parallel Input/Output controller.

- programmed via Z80-compatible chip-pin bitmask
- two callbacks for passive port A/B input/output
- write-function for active port A/B input (may trigger interrupt)
- can act as interrupt controller in a Z80 interrupt-daisy-chain
- NOT IMPLEMENTED:
    - bidirectional mode

### Z80 CTC (chips/z80ctc.h)

The Zilog Z80 Counter/Timer Channels.

- programmed via Z80-compatible chip-pin bitmask

### MOS 6502 CPU (chips/m6502.h)

The MOS Technology 6502 CPU.

- single tick-callback with CPU-pin bitmask, called with tick-granularity
- fast switch-case instruction decoder generated via python script
- emulates all(?) quirks (like redundant and 'junk' read/write cycles, variable cycle counts in some addressing modes, page boundary wrap-around in indirect jump, etc...), mostly verified via visual6502.org
- emulates the known and useful 'documented-undocumented' opcodes (like LAX, SAX, DCP, ...)
- decimal mode implemented, can be disabled
- test coverage:
    - **NESTEST**: completely working (this runs through all documented, and most 'common'
      undocumented instructions but doesn't test decimal mode)

### AY-3-8910 (chips/ay38910.h)

The General Instrument AY-3-8910 sound generator chip and its low-cost variants
AY-3-8912 and AY-3-8913 (the 3 variants only differ in the number of provided
I/O ports, the 8910 has 2 ports, the 8912 has 1, and the 8913 has none.

- programmable via chip-pin bitmask
- separate tick function called from CPU tick callback, returns true when a new audio sample is ready

### MC6845 (chips/mc6845.h)

Motorola 6845 video address generator and variants.

- programmable via chip-pin bitmask
- tick function which generates hsync, vsync, display-enable, 13-bit 
  memory-address and 5-bit row-address, returned as pin-mask

  a complete pin-mask and can be used to set the mode-select input pins
  (this is used in the Acorn Atom for instance, which directly connects
  data bus pins to MC6847 mode-select pins)

- toggle beeper state on/off from CPU tick callback
- tick function returns true when new audio-sample is ready

### CRT Cathode Ray Tube emulation (chips/crt.h)

A helper class to emulate the beam-position and -visibility of a cathode-ray-tube,
driven by HSYNC an VSYNC signals (for instance as generated by a mc6847 or mc6845).

- currently only supports the PAL video standard

### Clock (chips/clk.h)

Clock/timer helper functions. This currently only has a single function to
convert a duration in microseconds into a number of CPU ticks.
